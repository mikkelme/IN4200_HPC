The above figure shows 15 tasks, each taking 10 minutes to be carried out
by one worker. (Using more workers on the same task won’t save any time.)
Each arrow in the above figure means that the task being pointed cannot
start before the pointing task has finished. What will be the shortest time
for 4 equal workers to finish all the 15 tasks? Repeat the same question for
the case of 3 equal workers.

For the case of 4 workers (p=4) we take a symmetric approach.
We split two workes in each direction fwhen possible:

          4            = 10 min
     2        2        = 10 min
   1   1    1   1      = 10 min
  11  11   11  11      = 20 min.

  total time = 50 min.

For three workers we cannot shetch the flow like before.
We cannot utilize all workers before layer 3 such that we still
have a initial 10 + 10 = 20 min. computation time for the first two layers 
Then we have a remaining of 12 task which is divisble by 3. First we let the three workers
do any of the four task in layer three (one remain undone), and then in the next
computation one workers does the last in layer three while the remaing two workers go on the
last layer of unlocked task. From there all task are unlocked and since no time was wasted
it should all get divided equally. Since 12/3 = 4 it will take an additional 40 min. such
that the total time is 60 min.
