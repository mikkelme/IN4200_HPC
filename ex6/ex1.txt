There are n equal-sized independent tasks and p equal workers.
Suppose n is not divisible by p. How to divide the n tasks among
the p workers in a fair way?


If they cannot cooperate each worker get
n // p task each where the rest n%p get disributed
to only some of the workers. If they can cooperate
the rest should be distributed accros all the workers.
